A python based approach to synchronising local folders' contents'

This script compares "source"  hashes or sometimes the "lack" of source hashes from the designated "destination" folder and copies over missing files.
A pyinstaller bundled .exe file is also present within the repo's dist folder. May be used as a CLI application as well.
